# Burgers
## MVC application using hamburgers

* The user will enter a hambuger in the text box and click the **order** button
* That hamburger will then be added to the myqsl database and be added to the left-hand column on the screen
* While in the left-hand column, the burger can be clicked on and *consumed* where it is transferred to the right-hand column

The application if very simple in its functionality but is used to demonstrate the Model View Controller (MVC) coding paradigm.
